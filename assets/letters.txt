Professor Ewa Syta in the Department of Computer Science is a candidate for promotion to associate professor with tenure this year. Letters from students make up an important part of this review process.

 

I am writing to ask if you would be willing to write a letter sharing your interactions with Professor Syta, including her role as a teacher, advisor, or mentor. Please feel free to make any additional comments of your own.

Dear Sir or Madam and Trinity CPSC department,

I am writing this letter to nominate and recommend Professor Syta for promotion to Associate Professor and tenure at Trinity College.

My name is Binh Vo and I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Trinity College in 2019. After Trinity, I worked at Microsoft for 2.5 years as an Azure Technical Support Engineer. While my time at Microsoft, there were moments where I am thankful with the knowledge I had learned from being a student in Professor's syta courses, especially with her security course. It was a privilege to learn and explore Professor Syta's courses in software design and computer security, but also seeing her leadership skills being potrayed when she led the CPSC senior students seminar. Some of my favorite moments at Trinity were the materials taught in these courses and interactions with Professor Syta. Below are more details of my experiences and intereactions with Professor Syta. She is caring, smart, and driven not only for the students' success but also the Trinity's success. 

From my experiences with the lectures, Professor Syta's simple and methodical structure of teaching helped reinforce students with the contents learned in class. The lectures would be based off the assigned text, but Professor Syta would innovate the content and take it a step further for students to solidified what they had learned from the lectures through examples and code breakdown. 

A particular fun and great learning experience I recall was when the class was learning about decoupling code with design patterns, how to write our code cleanly, and have the components not be dependent on each other when writing a software. The topic sparked a frenzied, interesting debate in class on a variety of ways to write loose code using different design patterns. In order to solidify our learning, Professor Syta would challenge us with a real world example- to write a guitar inventory software and have us visualized the components needed for a guitar inventory shop. The project allowed students to be innovative in their designs but Professor Syta ensured we were following clean code principles such as descriptive names and single responsible principle. This allows students to get a taste of agile development and how software are written using the clean code principles. 


Another observation I noticed was her understandings and ability to work with different students. Before Professor Syta arrived to Trinity campus on my 3rd year, I wasn't confident in my ability as a computer science student. I felt like I was out of placed in my department, was not on par with my peers, and was considering changing my major to Music. However after meeting Professor Syta and taken some her courses, I felt reassured by her. I felt like she had faith in my abilities even though I wasn't performing to a high degree. The best way to describe it is a warm feeling. I felt like my abilities was not put off due to low statistic results but the efforts Professor Syta see I and the students had to put in. She was like a mentor. After her arrival and involvement on campus, I began to ask questions more confidently in lectures and not shy away from questions. It taught me that success is not easy and we have to fail and learn from our failures in order to succeed. Without failures and trails, it would be hard to grow without seeing the flaws.


Overall, my experiences with Professor Syta were amazing. Trinity is fortunate to have a professor that cares about her students and is knowledgeable in the computer science field. Professor Syta would be a spectacular addition to our computer science department with this promotion. I hope you guys consider her tenure because she is loving, knowledgable, intelligent in every ways.  

Thank you. If you guys have any questions, please do not hesitate to reach out to me. It was an honor to write this letter. Happy New Year! Go Bantams!

My name is Binh Vo. I saw you guys post and was really excited to have a chance to apply to this opportunity as an Apprentice Software Engineer.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science from Trinity College in 2019 and since have been working at Microsoft as a Azure Technical Support Engineer.

First and foremost,  I would like to pursue at this opportunity because I feel like this would be the best chance to for me to learn about a growing technology solution as we keep have devices connecting to an expanding internet. In addition, I would have an opportunity to learn and grow as a developer. My interest in programming first began in high school when I first learned how to use JavaScript to create animation and make the objects move and interact with each other. I followed my high school passion and enrolled at Trinity College to pursue Computer Science. During my time at Trinity, I was introduced to a variety of courses and concepts in Computer Science and programming including but not limited to Object-Oriented Programming, Data Structures, Algorithms, Theory of Computation, and Software Designs. My programming interests heightened when I learned about Game Development and Artificial Intelligence while I was studying abroad. At this point in my education, I gained skills that helped me apply the knowledge during projects and internships. 

My first internship during college was a Data Visualization internship at the Hartford State Capital non-partisan news outlet. I worked closely with a data reporter to analyze bail bond statistics rate each county in Connecticut. Then we would use the data and implement data visualization charts to compare the US Bond rate and Connecticut bond rate. Using the underlying bond rate data, I learned how to implement a leaflet map, table visualizations using HTML/CSS/Javascript and an open-source library to visualize and express a news story. 
The next internship, Software Engineer intern, at the Airoom Architects gave me valuable experience in learning how to develop, design, and maintain software. One of the first major projects that I was involved in included developing modules in Java to use Restful API to update objects for the User Interface components level. This experience also taught me how to maintain and write loosely coupled code by implementing software design patterns such as the Model View Controller for the components and data to be loose and not directly dependent on each other. 

After graduating with a degree in Computer Science, I was recruited by Microsoft as an Azure Virtual Machine Support Engineer. The position provides me an immense knowledge of cloud computing. As an Azure VM Support Engineer, I assist and consult enterprise partners in resolving software problems through analytical problems solving skills and technical expertise. To give an example, I helped build an ARM(Azure Resource Manager) JSON template to help MS partners automate their Virtual Machine deployment. In addition, I assist in implementing scripts to automate the process efficiency to encrypt and resize virtual machines. My goal is to learn to grow my carreer to help develop efficient software to solve a variety of complex business issues to further automate the resolution efficiency.


By having the opportunity to experience many different projects throughout my programming career, I am interested in pursuing the role to further improve my programming concepts and techniques. In addition, the exciting opportunity to learn about the solution Hologram has provided with their platform. I look forward to joining the program, and thank you for your time and consideration.
